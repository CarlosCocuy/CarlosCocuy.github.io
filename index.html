      Hello, I am Carlos Cocuy. I am a graduate student at UCF pursuing a Masters in Data Analytics.
      My goal is to graduate by 2020 and get a job working at the Walt Disney Company as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.
      While doing my masters I am also working on a Data Analytics bootcamp to learn any tool I could have to work with in the future.
    </p>

      In my free time, I am a musician. I was in the Marching Knights for several years as a percussionist and even served as a section leader.
      My grandfather, whom I was named after, taught me how to play drums when I was 3 years old and I have been working to hold up his name ever since.
      While in highschool, I wanted to give back to my community so I want to a local preschool and offered to be a volunteer music teacher and would show up at the end of the kids day
      to play drums with them on these small little plastic drums. I wasn't the best teacher but I know the kids had a lot of fun!
